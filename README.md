# lydian-spring
Lydian Spring is an adventure game where the main character explores the area around her and uses objects she finds to construct tools, armor, and weapons to progress further in the game. The constructive nature of the the game has elements similar to Minecraft and Terraria, but this game will have more fixed areas of exploration and linear story. The game takes place in a futuristic semi-wasteland, with elements similar to Nausica of the Valley of the Winds - a central refuge surrounded on many sides by toxic danger. The main character works with her friends and neighbors to improve the environment around her village, increasing the area for cultivation and decreasing exposure to surrounding dangers. As the player explorers further beyond the villageâ€™s immediate boundaries, contact with outside forces and groups will influence the plot of the game.
